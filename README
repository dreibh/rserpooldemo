How to run the RSerPool demo:

1. Run "qmake-qt4"
This will create the Makefiles.

2. Run "make"
This will compile everything.

3. Go to "bin/" directory and run "./rserpooldemo -config=local-setup.xml"
 If you want to configure the dummy interface or run Wireshark from within
 the GUI, run it as root!
